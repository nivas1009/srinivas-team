Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('traffic_accidents.csv')

Preprocess the data
X = df.drop(['accident_occurred'], axis=1)  # Features
y = df['accident_occurred']  # Target variable

Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Train a random forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Model Accuracy:', accuracy)
print('Classification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
